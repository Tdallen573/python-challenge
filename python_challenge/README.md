# Module 3 Challenge
Here is the code with the correct directories to store the resources and the analysis for the module 3 challenge. In the PyBank directory you will find the code in the main.py file and the budget data stored in the Resources directory and the txtfile stored in the analysis directory. The PyPoll directory is organized almost identically just that instead of using the budget data csv it has the election data csv stored in the Resource directory. both main.py files ran without errors have been commented and had the resulting analysis text file uploaded.
